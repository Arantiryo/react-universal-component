# react-universal-component

A universal component for rendering a group of fields according to the config.

Vite was chosen as an alternative for Webpack as it works well with Typescript out of the box and allows to quickly prototype simple projects.

`RenderGroup` component exposes field's values through `useImperativeHandle` and `useRef` hooks as an alternative to simply lifting satate up to a partent component.

The project is deployed on [netlify](https://react-universal-component.netlify.app/).
